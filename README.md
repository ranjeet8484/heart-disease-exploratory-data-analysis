# ❤️ Heart Disease Exploratory Data Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a heart disease dataset to understand patient demographics, clinical attributes, and their relationship with heart disease occurrence. The aim is to uncover meaningful patterns and insights through data visualization and statistical exploration, without building predictive models.

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains patient-level medical and diagnostic information, including:
- Age and gender
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Serum cholesterol
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Fasting blood sugar
- Exercise-induced angina
- ECG-related indicators
- Target variable indicating presence of heart disease

The data was checked for missing values and duplicate records before analysis.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
The analysis was carried out through a structured EDA workflow, including:
- Initial data inspection (shape, data types, missing values)
- Descriptive statistics to understand feature distributions
- Correlation analysis between clinical variables
- Distribution analysis of the target variable
- Demographic analysis based on age and gender
- Clinical feature analysis including chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart rate
- Visualization using histograms, bar plots, box plots, and correlation heatmaps

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Heart disease prevalence increases with age, particularly among middle-aged and older patients
- Male patients show a higher proportion of heart disease cases compared to females
- Certain chest pain types are strongly associated with heart disease presence
- Maximum heart rate achieved shows a negative relationship with heart disease
- Exercise-induced angina and ST depression emerge as important clinical indicators
- Cholesterol and resting blood pressure show high variability with overlapping distributions

---

## 🧠 Outcome
This project demonstrates how **exploratory data analysis** helps in understanding healthcare data, identifying important risk indicators, and building a strong foundation for future predictive modeling or advanced analytics.
